 * **XMPP Connection manager**
 *
 * This class is the main part of Strophe.  It manages a BOSH or websocket
 * connection to an XMPP server and dispatches events to the user callbacks
 * as data arrives.
 *
 * It supports various authentication mechanisms (e.g. SASL PLAIN, SASL SCRAM),
 * and more can be added via
 * {@link Connection#registerSASLMechanisms|registerSASLMechanisms()}.
 *
 * After creating a Connection object, the user will typically
 * call {@link Connection#connect|connect()} with a user supplied callback
 * to handle connection level events like authentication failure,
 * disconnection, or connection complete.
 *
 * The user will also have several event handlers defined by using
 * {@link Connection#addHandler|addHandler()} and
 * {@link Connection#addTimedHandler|addTimedHandler()}.
 * These will allow the user code to respond to interesting stanzas or do
 * something periodically with the connection. These handlers will be active
 * once authentication is finished.
 *
 * To send data to the connection, use {@link Connection#send|send()}.

     * @property {SASLMechanism[]} [mechanisms]
     *  Allows you to specify the SASL authentication mechanisms that this
     *  instance of Connection (and therefore your XMPP client) will support.
     *
     *  The value must be an array of objects with {@link SASLMechanism}
     *  prototypes.
     *
     *  If nothing is specified, then the following mechanisms (and their
     *  priorities) are registered:
     *
     *      Mechanism       Priority
     *      ------------------------
     *      SCRAM-SHA-512   72
     *      SCRAM-SHA-384   71
     *      SCRAM-SHA-256   70
     *      SCRAM-SHA-1     60
     *      PLAIN           50
     *      OAUTHBEARER     40
     *      X-OAUTH2        30
     *      ANONYMOUS       20
     *      EXTERNAL        10
     *
     * @property {boolean} [explicitResourceBinding]
     *  If `explicitResourceBinding` is set to `true`, then the XMPP client
     *  needs to explicitly call {@link Connection.bind} once the XMPP
     *  server has advertised the `urn:ietf:propertys:xml:ns:xmpp-bind` feature.
     *
     *  Making this step explicit allows client authors to first finish other
     *  stream related tasks, such as setting up an XEP-0198 Stream Management
     *  session, before binding the JID resource for this session.
     *
     * @property {'ws'|'wss'} [protocol]
     *  _Note: This option is only relevant to Websocket connections, and not BOSH_
     *
     *  If you want to connect to the current host with a WebSocket connection you
     *  can tell Strophe to use WebSockets through the "protocol" option.
     *  Valid values are `ws` for WebSocket and `wss` for Secure WebSocket.
     *  So to connect to "wss://CURRENT_HOSTNAME/xmpp-websocket" you would call
     *
     *      const conn = new Strophe.Connection(
     *          "/xmpp-websocket/",
     *          {protocol: "wss"}
     *      );
     *
     *  Note that relative URLs _NOT_ starting with a "/" will also include the path
     *  of the current site.
     *
     *  Also because downgrading security is not permitted by browsers, when using
     *  relative URLs both BOSH and WebSocket connections will use their secure
     *  variants if the current connection to the site is also secure (https).
     *
     * @property {string} [worker]
     *  _Note: This option is only relevant to Websocket connections, and not BOSH_
     *
     *  Set this option to URL from where the shared worker script should be loaded.
     *
     *  To run the websocket connection inside a shared worker.
     *  This allows you to share a single websocket-based connection between
     *  multiple Connection instances, for example one per browser tab.
     *
     *  The script to use is the one in `src/shared-connection-worker.js`.
     *
     * @property {boolean} [sync]
     *  Used to control whether BOSH HTTP requests will be made synchronously or not.
     *  The default behaviour is asynchronous. If you want to make requests
     *  synchronous, make "sync" evaluate to true.
     *
     *  > const conn = new Strophe.Connection("/http-bind/", {sync: true});
     *
     *  You can also toggle this on an already established connection.
     *
     *  > conn.options.sync = true;
     *
     * @property {string[]} [customHeaders]
     *  Used to provide custom HTTP headers to be included in the BOSH HTTP requests.
     *
     * @property {boolean} [keepalive]
     *  Used to instruct Strophe to maintain the current BOSH session across
     *  interruptions such as webpage reloads.
     *
     *  It will do this by caching the sessions tokens in sessionStorage, and when
     *  "restore" is called it will check whether there are cached tokens with
     *  which it can resume an existing session.
     *
     * @property {boolean} [withCredentials]
     *  Used to indicate wether cookies should be included in HTTP requests (by default
     *  they're not).
     *  Set this value to `true` if you are connecting to a BOSH service
     *  and for some reason need to send cookies to it.
     *  In order for this to work cross-domain, the server must also enable
     *  credentials by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` response header
     *  to "true". For most usecases however this setting should be false (which
     *  is the default).
     *  Additionally, when using `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, the
     *  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header can't be set to the wildcard "*", but
     *  instead must be restricted to actual domains.
     *
     * @property {string} [contentType]
     *  Used to change the default Content-Type, which is "text/xml; charset=utf-8".
     *  Can be useful to reduce the amount of CORS preflight requests that are sent
     *  to the server.

     *
     * ### Options
     *
     * With the options argument, you can specify boolean flags that affect how
     * matches are being done.
     *
     * Currently two flags exist:
     *
     * * *matchBareFromJid*:
     *     When set to true, the from parameter and the
     *     from attribute on the stanza will be matched as bare JIDs instead
     *     of full JIDs. To use this, pass {matchBareFromJid: true} as the
     *     value of options. The default value for matchBareFromJid is false.
     *
     * * *ignoreNamespaceFragment*:
     *     When set to true, a fragment specified on the stanza's namespace
     *     URL will be ignored when it's matched with the one configured for
     *     the handler.
     *
     *     This means that if you register like this:
     *
     *     >   connection.addHandler(
     *     >       handler,
     *     >       'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc',
     *     >       null, null, null, null,
     *     >       {'ignoreNamespaceFragment': true}
     *     >   );
     *
     *     Then a stanza with XML namespace of
     *     'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' will also be matched. If
     *     'ignoreNamespaceFragment' is false, then only stanzas with
     *     'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' will be matched.
     *
     * ### Deleting the handler
     *
     * The return value should be saved if you wish to remove the handler
     * with `deleteHandler()`.
     *
     * @param {Function} handler - The user callback.
     * @param {string} ns - The namespace to match.
     * @param {string} name - The stanza name to match.
     * @param {string|string[]} type - The stanza type (or types if an array) to match.
     * @param {string} id - The stanza id attribute to match.
     * @param {string} [from] - The stanza from attribute to match.
     * @param {HandlerOptions} [options] - The handler options
     * @return {Handler} A reference to the handler that can be used to remove it.
