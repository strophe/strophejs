## Version 1.2.12 - 2017-01-15

* Reduce the priority of the SASL-EXTERNAL auth mechanism. OpenFire 4.1.1

  installs are not set up to support SASL-EXTERNAl, causing them to fail
  logging users in.

* 189 Strophe never reaches DISCONNECTED status after .connect(..) and
  .disconnect(..) calls while offline.

  responding presence (e.g. when leaving a MUC room).

  `matchBareFromJid`. The old name will still work in this release but is
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* #114 Add an error handler for HTTP calls
* #213 "XHR open failed." in BOSH in IE9
* #214 Add function to move Strophe.Builder pointer back to the root node
* #172, #215 Don't compare `to` and `to` values of sent and received IQ stanzas
